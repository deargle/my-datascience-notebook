A convenience docker image built from `jupyter/datascience-notebook` that installs packages from
a `requirements.txt` file. Follows the recipe shown [here](https://jupyter-docker-stacks.readthedocs.io/en/latest/using/recipes.html#using-mamba-install-or-pip-install-in-a-child-docker-image).

I use this in the classes I teach, so that everyone has the same package versions without too
much fiddling.
